Title: Windows 10 RDP Setup Tutorial with GitHub and AnyDesk

[Introduction]
Welcome back to our channel! In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up and run Windows 10 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) using GitHub and AnyDesk. Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. A new GitHub account (if you don't have one already).
2. The workflow.yml file, which you can download from the link provided in the description.
3. AnyDesk software or app installed on your computer.

[Prerequisite Steps]
Now, let's quickly go through the steps to complete the prerequisites together. Once you have finished these steps, we'll proceed to the main tutorial.

1. Create a new GitHub repository by navigating to github.com and signing in with your account. Click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
2. Inside the repository, click on the "Create new file" button.
3. In the file name field, type ".github/workflows/test" and press enter. This will create a new folder and file.
4. Copy the contents of the downloaded workflow script into the newly created file.
5. Scroll down, and you'll see an empty box where you need to type "test" as the commit message.
6. Finally, click on the "Commit changes" button to upload the workflow script to your repository.

[Main Tutorial Steps]
Great job completing the prerequisites! Now, let's move on to the main tutorial and deploy and run Windows 10 RDP.

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Under the "Workflows" section, you should see the system workflow that you uploaded. Click on it to open it.
3. On the left side, you'll find a button labeled "Run workflow." Click on it to start the workflow.
4. Now, wait for a few minutes while the workflow is being executed. This process will set up your Windows 10 RDP environment.
5. Once the workflow has finished running, you will need to copy the AnyDesk ID provided in the workflow output.

[Connecting to the Windows 10 RDP]
Now that we have the AnyDesk ID, let's connect to our Windows 10 RDP.

1. Locate the AnyDesk application or software on your computer and open it.
2. In the AnyDesk window, you'll find a field where you can enter the AnyDesk ID. Paste the ID that you copied from the workflow output into this field.
3. Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection with the Windows 10 RDP.
4. If prompted, fill in the login information. For the "Authorization Password," enter "disalardp" (without quotes).
5. Finally, click on "Login" or "Connect" to access your Windows 10 RDP environment.
